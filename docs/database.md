All Chinese text is **Traditional Chinese** (converted from Simplified via OpenCC at build time).

Raw HTML is exported to Cloudflare R2 via `scripts/export_for_r2.py`, not stored in the database.

## Data Source

`Body.data` in the macOS dictionary bundle stores entries as sequential zlib-compressed HTML blocks. Each block has a 12-byte header:

```
[sz1: 4B][sz2: 4B][decompressed_size: 4B][zlib data: sz2-4 bytes]
```

First block at offset `0x60`. Each decompressed block is Apple Dictionary Services XML with rich HTML content including definitions, examples, pronunciation, collocations, etymology, and more.

## Build Pipeline

1. **Index**: Scan `Body.data` to map 62,131 headwords to byte offsets
2. **Parse**: Decompress each entry and extract structured data via regex
3. **Convert**: Apply OpenCC `s2t` to all Chinese text fields
4. **Store**: Insert into SQLite with batch transactions
5. **Variants**: Build alternate spelling index
6. **Optimize**: Run PRAGMA optimize

Audio files and raw HTML are uploaded separately to Cloudflare R2 via `scripts/upload_to_r2.sh`.

## Audio File Naming

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Word pronunciation | `{word}__{dialect}_{n}.mp3` | `run__gb_1.mp3` |
| Phrase pronunciation | `{phrase}_{sense}_{dialect}_{n}.mp3` | `run_down_1_gb_1.mp3` |
| Sentence example | `_{word}__{code}_{n}.mp3` | `_run__gbs_1.mp3` |

Dialect codes: `gb`/`us` for words; `gbs`/`uss`/`brs`/`ams` for sentences.
